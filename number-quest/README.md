## How It Works

1. The computer generates a secret number between **1 and 100**.
2. The player has **10 attempts** to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the game tells the player if the secret number is **higher** or **lower** than their guess.
4. If the player guesses the number, they win! Otherwise, the game ends after 10 attempts.
